            Design is an intriguing process with communication forming the basis of its execution. Architects are gifted at the art of communication. Be it verbal, conceptual, diagrammatic, or written, every architect has his way of communicating his/her thoughts.

                Self-expression is of utmost importance to these creative individuals, and hence they seek different mediums to get their ideas across the table. Although a lot of architects prefer strokes over words, there is no constraint on this expression and is often channelized through writing, dancing, painting, and even through music.

              <p>
                Despite the messy work desks and an unmanageable sleep schedule, architects are pretty good when it comes to planning and organizing. Time management is never a problem for them because they have been under the practice of completely utilizing the 24-hour time span since their student days.

              <p>
                The ability to reason unlocks another trait in architects-problem solving. Architects like to believe that there is no such problem that cannot be solved through design interventions by employing innovative techniques and strategies.
